# WELCOME TO GPS TRACKER APP
I made this app for out thesis paper entiled "Real-Time Fleet Monitoring: GPS-GSM System for Mini-Bus Tracking and Public Alerts".
This system is specifically design for realtime Mini-Bus monitoring in San Isidro Rodriguez, Rizal.
With this app, it will reduce uncertainty and waiting time for the commuters and help them plan their trip better.
This will also increase commuters safety and security.

## APP FEATURES
